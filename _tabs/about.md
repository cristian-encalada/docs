Hello! My name is __Cristian__.

I'm an Electronics Engineer from __Bolivia__, living currently in __Uruguay__.

Right now I'm doing a __Software Development Bootcamp__ in [Holberton School Uruguay](https://holbertonschool.uy/).

I'm very interested in any topic related to science and technology.

I support The __Open Software Foundation__ (OSF) and all kinds of open software and hardware projects. These projects can be shared, improved upon, and can help numerous people.

I began this blog to track the various topics I've learned about and to share my knowledge with anyone who's interested. 


I firmly believe that __knowledge should be shared and free__, also, teaching or sharing knowledge is the most effective way to gain a deeper understanding of any subject.
