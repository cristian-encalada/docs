This guide will help you to install Windows and Arch Linux with dual-boot and custom boot partition size. 

Linux is an excellent operative system talking about software development, but sometimes we need specific tools or games which only run on Windows, and even tough there are software such as Wine or Proton, the most simple solution to this problem is to have a dual boot with Windows and whatever Linux distribution you prefer.

## Pre-requisites

* Windows 10 or Windows 11 installed -> [Windows downloadd page](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)
* A stable internet connection (via ethernet or wifi)
* A USB drive to create a bootable device to install Arch (minimun with 1 GB storage)
* Basic knowledge of command line interface (CLI) and text editors (vim or nano)

## Unallocate space for Arch

Windows creates by default 3 partitions:

* EFI [100 MB] - also known as boot partition or EFI System
* Recovery [~500 MB] - Windows recovery environment
* System [NTFS] - primary partition on which Windows is installed (Typically C: drive)

In my case, I have a 1 TB HDD (~931.5 GB) with the 3 partitions and one additional NTFS partition for other files in Windows 10:

`Initial Windows partitions:`

* [EFI] System(1GB) - boot partition
* [WIN] C: Primary (~200GB) for Windows
* [WIN] D: Data (~500GB) for other files on Windows

The first thing that we need to do, is create some unallocated space to install Arch Linux (or any othe rdistribution).

On Windows: 

1. Right click on My PC -> Manage -> Storage -> Disk Management
2. Right click on the partition where Windows is installed (by default C:) -> Shrink Volume
3. Shrink volume will automatically calculate the maximum space that you can shrink, you also can enter the size you want to shrink, in our case we will have 200GB unallocated for Arch Linux, so, enter 200000 MB and then select [Shrink]

`Windows partitions after shrink:`

* [EFI] System(1GB) - boot partition
* [WIN] C: Primary (~200GB) for Windows
* [WIN] D: Data (~500GB) for other files on Windows
* [ARCH] Unallocated (215 GB)

__Note:__ In the image above, the 200 GB are not unallocated because I already have Linux installed. Initially will be unallocated space, for some other reference images, check -> [Create a separate partition for installation of Arch Linux](https://www.linuxtechi.com/dual-boot-arch-linux-windows-10/).

## Create an Arch bootable USB drive

A bootable live USB is an external storage device that contains everything required to boot into a live environment/setup. There are multiple ways to create such a live environment; the classic way is do it with a USB drive.

First we need a USB drive with the Arch ISO file (An ISO file is an exact copy of an entire optical disk such as a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray archived into a single file, for more info, check [What Is an ISO File? Explained in Plain English](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-iso-file-explained-in-plain-english/)) . 

We can create the Arch live booteable in the USB drive using some software like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).

`Create the live booteable USB using Rufus:`

1. Download the Arch Linux ISO file (Torrent download) -> [Arch download page](https://archlinux.org/download/?ref=blog.realogs.in)

2. Download and install Rufus on Windows -> [rufus-4.2.exe](https://rufus.ie/en/):

3. Select the following options in `Drive Properties` (Format Options by default): 
    - __Device__: Your USB device
    - __Partition scheme__: GPT
    - __Target system__: UEFI (non CSM)

## Boot From the USB Device

Follow these steps to boot from a flash drive, an external hard drive, or some other bootable USB device.

1. Change the boot order in BIOS so the USB device option is listed first. The BIOS is rarely set up this way by default. (If the USB boot option is not first in the boot sequence, your PC will start "normally" (i.e., boot from your hard drive) without even looking at any boot information that might be on your USB device)

2. Attach the USB device to your computer via any available USB port.

3. Save the BIOS boot order changes and restart the computer.

## Install Arch Linux

### 1. Begin the installation of Arch Linux

On the bootup screen, you will be presented with options as shown below. Select the first option – `Arch Linux install medium (x86_64, UEFI)` and hit ENTER.

![Boot Arch install](/static/images/2023-09-08-install-arch-linux-dual-boot-win10-UEFI/0_Arch_install.webp)

This initialize Arch Linux as evidenced by the boot messages on the screen.

![Initialize Arch](/static/images/2023-09-08-install-arch-linux-dual-boot-win10-UEFI/1_Arch_install.webp)

After a few seconds, the `root@archiso` prompt should be shown as below.

![root archiso](/static/images/2023-09-08-install-arch-linux-dual-boot-win10-UEFI/2_Arch_install.webp)

To verify the EFI support, run this command:

```sh
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
```

You should get some entries on the screen as shown. If nothing is listed on your screen, then it means you are using MBR and this guide won’t work for you in configuring up a dual boot setup.

```

### 2. Connect to wifi or ethernet network

We need to ensure to have internet connection in order to setting time and date and installing the base linux and some packages.

To connect to the ethernet, simply plug in the ethernet cablee and that's all.

To connect to a wifi network, we can use iwd (iNet wireless daemon), it comes in the Arch ISO, so, excute this command:

```sh
iwctl
```

Use the daemon

```sh
iwd
```

```sh
device list
```

```sh
station wlan0 get_networks
```

```sh
station wlan0 connect <networkName>
```

You can ping Google site to verify the connection:
```sh
ping google.com -c 4
```

output
```sh
PING google.com (142.251.133.14) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

### 3. Update time and date

Find your timezone ("q" to stop listing)

```sh
timedatectl list-timezones
```
output:
```sh
Africa/Abidjan
Africa/Accra
Africa/Addis_Ababa
Africa/Algiers
Africa/Asmara
Africa/Asmera
Africa/Bamako
Africa/Bangui
Africa/Banjul
Africa/Bissau
Africa/Blantyre
Africa/Brazzaville
Africa/Bujumbura
Africa/Cairo
Africa/Casablanca
...
```

In my case, my timezone is `America/Montevideo`, so, let's set the timezone with this command:

```sh
timedatectl set-timezone America/Montevideo
```

Verify your timezone

```sh
timedatectl status
```
output:
```sh
               Local time: Sun 2023-10-08 12:21:33 -03
           Universal time: Sun 2023-10-08 15:21:33 UTC
                 RTC time: Sun 2023-10-08 15:21:33
                Time zone: America/Montevideo (-03, -0300)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no
```

### 4. Create the Linux partitions

__Important: Be very careful with this section, because selecting or using the wrong partitions could remove the windows files/folders and cause data loss, backup your important data before continue__

Verify your current windows partitions (list block devices), with this command:

```sh
lsblk
```
output:
```sh
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0   100M  0 part
├─sda2   8:2    0    16M  0 part
├─sda3   8:3    0   200G  0 part
├─sda4   8:4    0   522M  0 part
├─sda5   8:5    0 516.3G  0 part
```

Another opton to verify the windows partitios is the command:

```sh
fdisk -l
```
output:
```sh
Disk /dev/sda: 931.51 GiB, 1000204886016 bytes, 1953525168 sectors
Disk model: TOSHIBA MQ01ABD1
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: E76D7293-6FAD-AEDB-6170-BD964057BFAD

Device          Start        End    Sectors   Size Type
/dev/sda1        2048     206847     204800   100M EFI System
/dev/sda2      206848     239615      32768    16M Microsoft reserved
/dev/sda3      239616  419589290  419349675   200G Microsoft basic data
/dev/sda4   419592192  420661247    1069056   522M Windows recovery environment
/dev/sda5   420663296 1503373311 1082710016 516.3G Microsoft basic data
```

A simple way to create the partitions is using the `cfdisk` utility. Run the command:
```
cfdisk
```
This displays all the partitions available including Windows partitions.

![View all partitons](/static/images/2023-09-08-install-arch-linux-dual-boot-win10-UEFI/4_Arch_install.webp)

As you can see, there is some free space, created earlier from shrinking drive C on the Windows side. Using this partition, we shall create the following Linux partitions (home is optional):

* root -> 50 GB
* swap -> 15 GB
* home -> 150 GB

__Create the root partition__

To achieve this, navigate to the free space with and hit ENTER. We will then specify the `Partition size: 50G` for the `root` partition. Then hit ENTER.

The root partition will be created with the `Linux filesystem` type.


__Create the home partition__

To achieve this, navigate to the remaining free space with and hit ENTER. We will then specify the `Partition size: 200G` for the `home` partition. Then hit ENTER.

The root partition will be created with the `Linux filesystem` type.


__Create the swap partition__

To achieve this, navigate to the remaining free space with and hit ENTER. We will then specify the `Partition size: 14G` (all the remaining) for the `swap` partition. Then hit ENTER.

Since this will be our swap partition, we need to go the extra step and modify the partition type. Therefore, we will select the `type` option and hit ENTER.

In the list that appears, select `Linux Swap` and hit ENTER.

![swap option](/static/images/2023-09-08-install-arch-linux-dual-boot-win10-UEFI/10_Arch_install.webp)


At this point, both the root and Linux swap partitions are created

To save the partitions, select the `Write` option and hit ENTER.

![Write option](/static/images/2023-09-08-install-arch-linux-dual-boot-win10-UEFI/11_Arch_install.webp)

When prompted if you want to write the partition to disk, simply type `yes` and hit ENTER.

![Write changes? yes](/static/images/2023-09-08-install-arch-linux-dual-boot-win10-UEFI/12_Arch_install.webp)

To exit cfdisk utility, select the `Quit` option and hit ENTER.

![Quit option](/static/images/2023-09-08-install-arch-linux-dual-boot-win10-UEFI/13_Arch_install.webp)

Verify that all linux partitions were created properly, use this command:

```sh
lsblk
```

```sh
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0   100M  0 part
├─sda2   8:2    0    16M  0 part
├─sda3   8:3    0   200G  0 part
├─sda4   8:4    0   522M  0 part
├─sda5   8:5    0 516.3G  0 part /mnt/windows-sda5
├─sda6   8:6    0    50G  0 part 
├─sda7   8:7    0   150G  0 part 
└─sda8   8:8    0  14.6G  0 part [SWAP]
```

### 5. Format the linux partitions

__Important: Be very careful with this section, because selecting or using the wrong partitions could remove the windows files/folders and cause data loss, backup your important data before continue__

For the partitions to become usable and available for use, we need to format them and later mount them.

To format the root partition, run the command:
```sh
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda6
```

To format the home partition, run the command:
```sh
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda7
```

To format the swap partition, run the command:
```sh
mkswap /dev/sda8
```

Then enable swap using the swapon command shown:
```sh
swapon /dev/sda8
```

### 6. Mount the linux partitions

Next, we need to mount the root partition to the /mnt directory

```sh
mount /dev/sda6 /mnt
```

mount the root partition to the /mnt/home directory

```sh
mount /dev/sda7 /mnt/home
```
Verify that root and home linux partitions were mounted properly, use this command:

```sh
lsblk
```

```sh
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0   100M  0 part
├─sda2   8:2    0    16M  0 part
├─sda3   8:3    0   200G  0 part
├─sda4   8:4    0   522M  0 part
├─sda5   8:5    0 516.3G  0 part 
├─sda6   8:6    0    50G  0 part /
├─sda7   8:7    0   150G  0 part /home
└─sda8   8:8    0  14.6G  0 part [SWAP]
```

### 7. Install base Linux and linux-firmware

Next, we are going to install the central packages for our Linux system including the base, Linux-firmware packages and some basic packages such as sudo, nano, vim, git networkmanager, dhcpcd and pulseaudio. That is going to take quite some time depending the internet connection speed.

```sh
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware sudo nano vim git networkmanager dhcpcd pulseaudio
```

Brief explanation what are the extra Linux packages are for:

* `sudo`: stands for "superuser do" and is a command that allows authorized users to execute commands as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. It is commonly used to perform administrative tasks that require elevated privileges. For example, you can use sudo to install software, configure system settings, or perform other system maintenance tasks.

* `nano` and `vim`: text editors for the command line.

* `git`: version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.

* `networkmanager`: is a Linux utility that simplifies the management of network connections. It provides a graphical and command-line interface to configure and control network settings, including wired, wireless, and mobile broadband connections.

* `dhcpcd`: is a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) client daemon for Linux. It automatically configures network interfaces by obtaining IP addresses, DNS servers, and other network-related information from a DHCP server. This tool is commonly used to set up network connections on Linux systems.

* `pulseaudio`: is a sound server for Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple applications to use audio simultaneously and provides features like volume control, audio redirection, and network audio streaming.


### 8. Generate a file system table (fstab)

The /etc/fstab file in Linux is used to configure and maintain information about the file systems (disk partitions or network shares) that should be automatically mounted at system startup.

Now we will generate the fstab file on the `/mnt` directory, use this command:

```sh
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

### 9. Configure root user (newly installed system)

Navigate to the newly created root filesystem
```sh
arch-chroot /mnt
```
You can verify that you are in the root filesystem using this command:
```sh
ls
```
Set a password for the root user
```sh
passwd
```

### 10. Create a new standard user

Create a new user:

```sh
useradd -m <new_user>
```
Set a password for the new user:
```sh
passwd <new_user>
```
Add the new user to the groups wheel, storage and power:
```sh
usermod -aG wheel,storage,power <new_user>
```
Execute this command:
```sh
visudo
```
Remove the comments (#) from these 2 lines (ESC and !x to exit and save the changes):
```sh
%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
Defaults timestamp_timeout=0
```

### 11. Set up the system language
The locale determines the system language, currency format, numbering and date on your system. This information is contained in the /etc/locale.gen  file. So, open the file using the vim editor.
```sh
vim /etc/locale.gen
```
Once you have accessed the file, scroll and uncomment your preferred locale. In this case, we have decided to go with `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`

Save and exit the file. Next generate the locale configuration using the command.
```sh
locale-gen
```
Next, create a new locale configuration file and save the locale as shown.
```sh
echo "LANG=EN_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
```
```sh
export "LANG=EN_US.UTF-8"
```

### 12. Set up the hostname

Next, we are going to configure the hostname of our Arch System. 

First, create a new file and specify the hostname as shown.

```sh
echo Arch > /etc/hostname
```

Modify the /etc/hosts file as follows.

```sh
vim /etc/hosts
```

`hosts` file:
```sh
127.0.0.1 localhost
::1 localhost
127.0.1.1 Arch.localdomain localhost
```

### 13. Set up the timezone and region

Time zone information is found in the `/usr/share/zoneinfo/` directory. To set your timezone, create a symbolic link to the `/etc/localtime` path.

Find your timezone ("q" to stop listing, ENTER to continue listing)

```sh
timedatectl list-timezones
```
output:
```sh
Africa/Abidjan
Africa/Accra
Africa/Addis_Ababa
Africa/Algiers
Africa/Asmara
Africa/Asmera
Africa/Bamako
Africa/Bangui
Africa/Banjul
Africa/Bissau
Africa/Blantyre
Africa/Brazzaville
Africa/Bujumbura
Africa/Cairo
Africa/Casablanca
...
```

In my case, my timezone is `America/Montevideo`, so, let's set the timezone with this command:

Execute this command:
```sh
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Montevideo /etc/localtime
```

Sync the hardware clock using the command:
```sh
hwclock --systohc
```

## Install the Grub bootloader

The boot partition (EFI System Partition) contains the bootloader which is responsible for booting the system. When dual booting, we create a single boot partition and load the entries for both the operating systems in one bootloader so that it's easier to select the option we want.


Find the windows EFI partition (~100 MB):

```sh
lsblk
```

```sh
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0   100M  0 part
├─sda2   8:2    0    16M  0 part
├─sda3   8:3    0   200G  0 part
├─sda4   8:4    0   522M  0 part
├─sda5   8:5    0 516.3G  0 part /mnt/windows-sda5
├─sda6   8:6    0    50G  0 part /
├─sda7   8:7    0   150G  0 part /home
└─sda8   8:8    0  14.6G  0 part [SWAP]
```

In this case, the `EFI partition` is the `sda1`, so, we are going to work there.

Create a directory for the EFI partition on which we will mount the Windows EFI system which , in our case is located on the `/dev/sda1` partition
```sh
mkdir /mnt/efi
```


Mount the EFI partition on the EFI mount point.
```sh
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/efi
```

Install the grub bootloader package alongside the efi boot manager package since we are using the UEFI mode.

```sh
pacman -S grub efibootmgr
```
Install the os-prober package which will enable Arch Linux to detect the Windows operating system.
```sh
pacman -S os-prober
```
Install the ntfs-3g package, it's a read/write NTFS driver for Linux, it provides safe handling of the Windows NTFS file systems. Also the update-grub utility could be helpful in some cases where the grub update is needed.

```sh
pacman -S nfts-3g update-grub
```
Make sure that GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false is uncommented to be able to detect Windows at the startup
```sh
vim /etc/default/grub
```
Uncomment this line (remove the #):
```sh
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```

Finally, install the grub on the EFI directory:
```sh
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/efi --bootloader-id=grub_uefi_arch
```

Install a grub configuration file as shown

```sh
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

The last line is an indication that Arch has detected the presence of Windows Boot manager on `/dev/sda1` partition.

Enable the dhcpcd and networkmanager services at the start of the system:

```sh
systemctl enable dhcpcd.service
```

```sh
systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
```

Done, exit and reboot the system.

```sh
exit
reboot
```

You can now boot into Arch linux or Windows through the GRUB bootloader:

Log in as your standard user `<new_user>` created in the step 10.

So for we have installed Arch Linux, that was the "difficult" part, later we can install some Linux [Desktop environment](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_environment) or only a [Window manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/window_manager), both are different things that will be covered in a future post.

Thanks for reading!
