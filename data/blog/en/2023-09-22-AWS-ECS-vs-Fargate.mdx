## What is ECS

![What is ECS?](/static/images/2023-09-22-AWS-ECS-vs-Fargate/0-what-is-ECS.png)

### What are the main purposes of orchestrators?

* Manage lifecycle of containers: create/restart/destroy
* Deploy and load-balance application across multiple servers
* Autoscaling to handle variance in traffic
* Rolling out changes to applicaation

## ECS competitors

### Docker Compose Deployment

The scale up with docker compose is more difficult.

We can only deploy in a single server at a time. To deploy in different servers we could copy the docker-compose.yml file, but it's not fully an orchestrated system.

### Traditional Orchestrators vs Amazon ECS 

Traditional Orchestrators such as Kubernetes, these all require a lot of effort to get up and running.

ECS was created as a simple alternative as an orchestrator that requires to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to configure almost the entire process for different services.

## EC2 vs Fargate

__ECS:__ Only works with containers, when a container is deployed, it still has to run in a physical or a virtual machine, but ECS does not act as a server, ECS does not have any service or compute power. 

ECS can only create and delete containers, but still needs the underlined infrastructure to be able to run those containers on.

__ECS Cluster:__ Is a bunch of resources (underlined resources) that the containers are going to run on. Is the physical infrastructure.

ECS has two launch types:

1. EC2 based launch type (EC2 = AWS Compute Service)
2. Fargate Service

![EC2 vs Fargate](/static/images/2023-09-22-AWS-ECS-vs-Fargate/5-EC2-Launch_types.png)

__EC2 Launch:__ We have to manage the underlying EC2 instances (infrastructure). We have to create the individual EC2 instances.

- You still need to manage the underlying __infrastructure__ (EC2)
- ECS manages the __containers__
- Full __control__ over your infrastructure

![EC2 Launch](/static/images/2023-09-22-AWS-ECS-vs-Fargate/6-EC2-launch.png)

__ECS Fargate Launch:__ AWS manages the underlying infrastructure (serverless deployment)

- Follows a __serverless__ architecture
- Fargate will create servers on __demand__
- No need to provision/mantain EC2 servers
- You only pay for what you use

## EC2 Task

### ECS Task Definition

- Is a blueprint that describes how containers should launch (intructions)
- How much CPU/MEM
- Image/Ports/Volumes

![EC2 Task definition](/static/images/2023-09-22-AWS-ECS-vs-Fargate/ECS-Task-definition-file.png)

### ECS Task

- An instance of a Task Definition
- A running container(s) with setting defined in the Task Definition

![EC2 Task Instance](/static/images/2023-09-22-AWS-ECS-vs-Fargate/ECS-Task-instance.png)


## ECS Services

- A service ensures that a certain number if __Tasks__ are running at __all__ times
- Restarts containers that have exited/crashed
- If a EC2 instance fails, the Service will restart the task on a __working__ EC2 instance

![ECS Services](/static/images/2023-09-22-AWS-ECS-vs-Fargate/10-ECS-Services.png)

## Load Balancers

- A Load Balancer can be assigned to __route__ external traffic of your server.
- Aditionally, after each deploy using AWS Fargate, a new IP address is generated, the Load Balancer can redirect all traffic comming to those dynamic IPs generated to a static URL configured.
